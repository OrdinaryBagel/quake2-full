This mod adds mini-games and roguelite-like progression systems to quake 2(random blessing were not added)

How to download: I've included the q2mod folder in this github branch. Simply move that folder into your Quake 2 folder and create a Quake 2 shortcut with '+set game q2mod' at the end to play the mod.

Currency(3 types):
  •  Medals: Gained everytime entering a new stage, saves between deaths, used to cycle through mini-games
  •  Gold: 100 gained per kill, used to upgrade health. Lost on death.
  •  Points: Gained on kill, amount depends on mini-game, used to upgrade damage. Lost on death.
Buffs:
  •  Health Up: Fully heals the player, increases max HP by 10 per level, costs 250 gold per level, max level 10, and resets on death.
  •  Damage UP: Increases player damage by 10 damage flat per level, costs 250 points per level, max level 9, and saves between deaths.
Mini-games(descriptions can also be found in the in-game help menu):
  •  Hyper mode: Double the player's movespeed, all player weapons fire 2 extra shots, and the player loses health over time. Points are also lost overtime, but are gain at 100 per kill.
  •  Sharshooter: All player shots are oneshots, player gains 50 points when a shot hits, player loses 25 points when hit, all enemies deal double damage.
  •  Gun-game: Forcces the player to cycle between currently owned weapons, player cannot switch weapons manually, player swaps weapons every kill, player gains 100 points when swapping weapons. Note: if the player only has the blaster they will not swap weapons but will still gain points

Other:
  •  Player medals and damage upgrades save on death.
  •  Dying forces the player to start a new game on the same difficulty.

Unimplemented feature: 10 random blessings were not implemented.
